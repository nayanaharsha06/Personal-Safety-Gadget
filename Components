 Components Used:
- Arduino UNO (x2): The Arduino UNO serves as the project's microcontroller, handling data processing, decision-making, and control of other components. 
It interfaces with sensors and the LED module to execute programmed logic and manage operations.

- SIM900A GSM Module: The SIM900A is a GSM/GPRS module supporting 900/1800MHz frequencies, enabling voice calls, SMS, and GPRS data transmission. 
It's compact and integrates easily via UART, ideal for remote monitoring and IoT applications. 
The SIM900A GSM module enables the "Personal Safety Gadget" to make voice calls to emergency services and send discreet SMS notifications to pre-designated contacts,
ensuring rapid and reliable communication during critical situations. SIM stands for Subscriber Identity Module.

- Relay Module (x1): The relay module allows the Arduino to control high-power devices. It acts as an electrical switch, enabling the microcontroller to manage devices requiring higher voltage and current.

- HC-05 Bluetooth Module (x1): The HC-05 module enables wireless communication via Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR. It supports both master and slave modes, facilitating data transmission between microcontrollers and other
devices using serial UART communication.

- Jumper Wires: Jumper wires are used to establish electrical connections between the components on a breadboard. They are essential for creating the circuit and ensuring proper connectivity.

- Power Adapter: The power adapter supplies stable and regulated power to the Arduino and other components. It ensures the entire system operates reliably by providing the necessary voltage and current.
